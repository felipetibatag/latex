\section{This is an example of head}
This is an \emph{example}
Difference between \textit{italic} and \textsl{slanted}\\
now text in \textbf{bold}
now text in \textsc{small caps}.

\section{\textsf{This is another example of head}}
another kind of \texttt{testing different text}

\section{\sffamily This is another test}
We will go to see

\section{Generate ID from Command}
\cedula\ was generated creating a new command with the sentences  \texttt{new command}\\
This is another example using \textit{new command} but now using the library called \textit{xspace}
which is useful for add automatic space after insert the automated text created with 
\textit{new command}, with that packaged isn't necessary insert a backslash after the command
for instance \cedula inserted sentence.

\section{Dealing with URLS}
For write URL is necessary use \texttt{url}, there are many different types of URL for instance:
\url{adfada.com}
\textbf{I'm currently in page ... I don't remember now jajajaj, something related with boxes..}

\section{Division's Columns}
For this I have to use \texttt{$\backslash$quad$\backslash$parbox\{xxcm\}\{text\}} or I can also use the \mbox{environment}\textit{minipage}.

\section{break lines with Hyphenation}
This is a long text and a simple example of how can I use \texttt{hyphenation} but for some strange reason doesn't work, works if I add $\backslash$- in the place where I want the word cut and down to the next line , \texttt{stat$\backslash$-ionary}, theoretically the word cuts after the \texttt{t}  and starts a new line with \texttt{ionary}.
